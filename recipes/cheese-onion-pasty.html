    <h1>Cheese and Onion Pasty</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A cheese and onion pasty is a classic staple of Cornish cuisine.
            It is a great dinner, served with homemade chips and baked beans.
            But you could just as easily enjoy yours with a quick pickle 
            on a picnic, as they taste great hot or cold. However 
            you eat them, I recommend a good shake of malt vinegar.
        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>40g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 medium waxy potato (about 250g), cut into 1cm dice</li>
            <li>200g cheddar, grated </li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp double cream (optional)</li>
            
            <h4>For the Pastry:</h4>
            <li>300g plain flour, plus extra to dust</li>
            <li>200g cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
            <li>1 medium free-range egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>40ml milk</li>
            <li>2 tsp white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 free-range egg, beaten, to glaze</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the pastry, put the flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Rub in the cubed butter between your thumbs and forefingers until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the egg, milk, and vinegar using a table knife. Using your hands, work the mixture until it comes together to form a dough – it should be soft but not sticky. Shape the dough into a ball on a flour-dusted work surface, flatten into a disc and cover in cling film. Set aside in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to rest (see Make Ahead)..</li>
            <li>For the filling, melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, covered for 10 minutes until softened. Stir regularly and add a little water if they start to look dry. Add the potato to the onions and continue to cook for 5-10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Heat the oven to 180ºC fan/gas 6. Divide the pastry into 4 equal pieces. Roll out one piece on a lightly floured surface to form a circle roughly 4-5mm thick (keep the rest of the pastry wrapped in the fridge).</li>
            <li>Stir the cheddar and cream (if using) through the cooled potato mixture, season with a good pinch of salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper (you want the mix to be heavily seasoned). Pile a quarter of the cooled filling on one half of the pastry, leaving a 3cm border around the edge. Brush the edges with a little beaten egg, then fold the other half over and press to enclose the filling. Crimp the edges of the pastry and place on a large, lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pastry and filling. Brush the pasties with the egg, poke with a fork so steam can escape, then bake for 25-30 minutes until golden (see Make Ahead)</li>
            <li>Serve the pasties, hot from the oven with chips and baked beans, or your favourite pickle if you like.</li>
        </ol>
